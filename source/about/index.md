[Resume](PoulosAlex_Resume_equulus.pdf).

I'm a Full Stack Cloud Developer at the Washington Post, where I work in the [Arc Publishing](https://www.arcpublishing.com/) division on the [Video Center](https://www.arcpublishing.com/products/) product. I love this role because it truly is full-stack: on any given day I might move from touching up a _Dockerfile_ and writing some CloudFormation, to diagnosing some slow MongoDB queries, after which I write some app layer code in Java or TypeScript and then move over to React for the front-end. 


Like many of my generation, I began writing code in middle school on a TI-83+ graphing calculator. I've been writing software on and off since. I did Java and Linux development at IBM for 3.5 years while in university, and then returned to technology full-time in the spring of 2019, after finishing a PhD in Classical Literature at [Catholic University of America](https://greek-latin.catholic.edu). My [dissertation](https://alexpoulos.com/dissertation/) was a study of the ancient Greek poetry of the early Christian poet [Gregory of Nazianzus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gregory_of_Nazianzus).

In addition to my full-time work, I've also done some freelance work over the past few years. Most recently, I've been working with a friend on [public health software](https://crosscut.io) for planning health campaigns. 

My tech stack of choice, at present, is serverless:
- __FrontEnd__: Vue (Vuex)
- __BackEnd__: TypeScript
- __Platform__: AWS Lambda + API Gateway (with CloudFormation)
- __Storage__: DynamoDB

I also have a fair amount of experience building and deploying more traditional containerized apps in both AWS (ECS) and GCP (GKE) with a variety of storage systems (Postgres and Mongo primarily). I've done a smattering of mobile development, some in Swift and some in React Native. I hold the AWS Solutions Architect, Associate certification. I love wrapping my mind around complicated systems and making different pieces work together: it's not unlike rendering a difficult piece of Ancient Greek verse into English. 

I retain my research interests in Ancient Greek and Latin literature. You can find my thoughts on literature and original poetry at [alexpoulos.com](https://alexpoulos.com).
