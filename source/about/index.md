I'm Alex Poulos. By day I work as a technologist; I moonlight as a scholar of AncientGreek and Latin literature. The latter has [alexpoulos.com](https://alexpoulos.com) as an outlet. This site is a primarily for musings, observations, and other sorts of writing on technology.  

I began writing code, like many of my generation, on a TI-83+ graphing calculator in my seventh grade Algebra class. I've been writing software on and off since. I worked at IBM for 3.5 years while in university (a mix of full and part-time), and then returned to technology full time in the spring of 2019, after finishing my PhD in Classical Literature at [Catholic University of America](https://greek-latin.catholic.edu).
